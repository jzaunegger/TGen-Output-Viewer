# TGen-Output-Viewer
A basic python script that allows you to view the output sentences from Text Generationg using the TGen Model for the E2E Challenge. 

This script reads .txt files from the 'dataset' directory location at the root of the repository. Here you can place the output text files from the Text Generation process of the TGen model. The program will ask you to enter a number, and will take that number and print out the sentence whose line number matches the input number. It is a very simple program using no dependencies besides built-in python modules.
